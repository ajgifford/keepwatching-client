# Product Context: KeepWatching Client

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem

Modern viewers subscribe to multiple streaming services and watch numerous shows and movies simultaneously. Traditional
methods of tracking viewing progress are inadequate:

- **No centralized tracking**: Users rely on memory or scattered notes
- **Service fragmentation**: Each streaming service has its own interface and tracking
- **Multi-user households**: Family members watch different content on shared accounts
- **Lost progress**: Easy to forget which episode you're on, especially for multiple shows
- **Discovery challenges**: Hard to find new content across multiple services

### The Solution

KeepWatching provides a unified, cross-platform tracking system that:

- Centralizes all viewing progress in one place
- Supports multiple profiles for household members
- Integrates with TMDB for comprehensive content metadata
- Provides real-time synchronization across devices
- Offers intelligent discovery and recommendations

## User Experience Goals

## How It Should Work

### Authentication Flow

1. User creates account via email or Google
2. System automatically creates default profile
3. User can add additional profiles for family members
4. Each profile maintains isolated watch data

### Content Tracking Flow

1. User searches for or discovers content
2. Adds show/movie to their profile
3. Marks episodes as watched individually or in bulk
4. System tracks progress at episode level
5. Shows appear in "Keep Watching" until completed
6. Upcoming episodes automatically tracked via TMDB

### Discovery Flow

1. User browses trending or service-specific content
2. Applies filters (genre, year, status)
3. Views detailed information and cast
4. Sees similar content recommendations
5. Adds to watchlist with one click

### Statistics Flow

1. User accesses statistics dashboard
2. Views profile-specific or account-wide data
3. Interactive charts show viewing patterns
4. Genre and service distribution visualized
5. Progress tracking for in-progress shows

### Real-Time Synchronization

1. User action triggers API call
2. Backend processes and validates
3. WebSocket broadcasts update to all connected clients
4. Redux state updates instantly
5. UI reflects new state without refresh
